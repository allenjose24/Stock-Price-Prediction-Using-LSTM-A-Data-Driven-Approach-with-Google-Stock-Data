# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM: A Data-Driven Approach with Google Stock Data


This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices using Google stock data. By analyzing historical trends and patterns, the model aims to provide accurate future price predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in financial forecasting.


## Key Features of the Code

### Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, converts the data format, scales features, and splits the data into training and testing sets.
Uses MinMaxScaler to scale the data between 0 and 1 for optimal performance with LSTM.
### Exploratory Data Analysis:

Includes candlestick charts to visualize stock trends.
Explores relationships between features like volume, open price, and their impact on the stock's performance.
### Feature Engineering:

Calculates additional metrics like Total Traded and Daily Returns.
Prepares sequences for the LSTM model.
### Model Definition and Training:

Defines a multi-layer LSTM model with dropout layers for regularization.
Compiles the model with adam optimizer and mean_squared_error loss function.
Tracks training and validation losses.
### Evaluation:

Uses RMSE as a metric to evaluate model performance.
Visualizes RMSE and actual vs. predicted values.
### Visualizations:

Provides comprehensive visualizations for insights, including loss trends and predictions using Plotly.

## Observations

### Code Structure: 

The code is well-structured and divided into logical sections, making it easy to follow.
### RMSE Calculation: 

RMSE provides an intuitive measure of prediction error. Visualizing these results enhances interpretability.
### Visualization Tools: 

Using Plotly ensures interactive and clear visualization of trends.

## Suggested Next Steps
### Hyperparameter Tuning:

Experiment with different numbers of LSTM layers, units, learning rates, and batch sizes to improve performance.
### Cross-Validation:

Implement cross-validation on time-series data using techniques like walk-forward validation.
### Additional Metrics:

Incorporate additional metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
### Further Explorations:

Evaluate the model's robustness by testing on different time frames or other stocks.
Investigate alternative architectures like GRU or attention-based models for comparison.
### Save and Deploy:

Save the trained model for deployment using TensorFlowâ€™s model.save() method.
Develop a real-time prediction feature by integrating the model with live stock data.
